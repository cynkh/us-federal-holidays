### us-federal-holidays
#A brief project to highlight some useful C#/MVC skills
Includes C# extension methods for int and DateTime string rendering, MVC route decoration, object-oriented modeling, and service layer separation.

This particular problem domain was selected because of its simplicity, extensibility (e.g., GUI, additional locales, etc.), and the fact that the returned results are verifiable independently using readily available resources (https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/federal-holidays).
